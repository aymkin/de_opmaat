# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

This is a Dutch language learning materials directory for the "De Opmaat" course (NT2 - Nederlands als Tweede Taal, targeting A2 level). It contains vocabulary lists, tests, audio files, and supplementary documents.

## Directory Structure

- `thema_1/` through `thema_4/` - Course materials organized by theme/chapter
- `other/` - Administrative documents (registration forms, payment receipts)
- Root contains supplementary materials (e.g., verb conjugation lists)

## Common File Types

- `.pdf` - Vocabulary lists (woordenlijst), tests (toetsen), answer keys (beoordeling)
- `.mp3` - Audio exercises and listening materials
- `.docx` - Word documents for forms and reference materials
- `.md` - Converted tests and grammar notes for interactive practice

## Common Tasks

### PDF to Markdown Conversion
Convert PDF tests to editable markdown for interactive practice sessions. Output should preserve exercise structure with blank answer spaces.

### Interactive Dutch Practice
- Review and correct user's Dutch sentences
- Provide grammar explanations when corrections are needed
- Track common spelling mistakes to reinforce learning

### Grammar Explanations
When explaining Dutch grammar, use tables to show word order patterns:
- **want** → normal word order (subject + verb)
- **omdat/als** → verb to the end
- **inversie** → when sentence starts with non-subject element

### Spelling Corrections
Common mistakes to watch for:
- kapot (not capot)
- stropdas (not stroopdas)
- het station (het-woord, not de)

## Language Context

- Primary language: Dutch (Nederlands)
- User's native language: Russian/Ukrainian
- Course level: A2 (elementary)
- Provide bilingual support when helpful (Dutch ↔ Russian/English)
